# Proposal

### * Write a brief statement, four lines of text, about the problem (not the solution) that your finished product will solve or the idea that it is based on. The problem has to be clearly described and very specific. We see a few possibilities: There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonable group of people have, which a web application is particularly suited to solve.

People don't know what to watch even though they pay for 4 different streaming subscriptions. 

### * Summarize your idea in one or two sentences, connecting it to the problem that you have defined. “This application will…”

This application will offer people the possibility to generate a random choice made for them to watch, hereby bypassing the dawdling and uncertainty. 

### * Describe your solution in moderate detail. You are sketching the “user experience”: the situation that a user might be in and of which using your website is a part.

A user has the option to choose a genre (or multiple), and from a list of streaming services. They can generate a movie by clicking the generate button.

The result screen will show the randomly generated movie, which streaming service has it on their site and a button to try again if the option does not interest the user.

### * Data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources can be found (downloaded or accessed via API). If you need to have an account to access the data, make the account now. Often it proves to be harder than expected to access good data.

Streaming Availability API

### * List the external components (libraries like sqlalchemy or bootstrap) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not very standard, include a link to its website. Specify what part you need and what for.

For now none.

### * Include a review of similar web apps, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way? (Spend a few lines per “competitor”.)

Similar idea using the same dataset. This one is a tad convoluted though, I am trying to make a simpler design.

### * Identify the hardest parts of implementing your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.

Getting the API to work properly with my application. I have never connected an API using javascript so working that out might be tough.
